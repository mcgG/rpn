# RPN Calculator Console Application

AC:

* Used `Spring boot` framework
* Used `AOP` to do logging, exception handling and result printing
* Log file is located in rpn/logs
* Added Unit test (Reflection used for RPNStackTest)
* Added customized properties for supported operators and decimal precision

ps:\
I am learning java right now, this is my first time using spring boot framework, and I have pushed this code to my github(github.com/mcgg/rpn), it will be great if you can kindly add some comments on it.
